        <h4>
            Software Engineer, <a href="https://theijf.org">
                The Investigative Journalism Foundation</a>

        <p>
           I research civic data and build software that improves it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am the IJF's primary backend engineer. Today I work mostly on 
            <a href="https://theijf.org/open-by-default">Open by Default</a>,
            Canada's largest ever trove of government documents. I built the internal
            platform we use to process the messy, irregular streams of files we receive 
            daily from more than 150 federal departments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Earlier, while helping the IJF launch, I built the system that powers our 
            stores of structured data. It collates disparate data sources from each
            province and territory into clean, useful formats. Most recently, we 
            published a <a href="https://theijf.org/procurement">Procurement</a> database.
        </p>
        <p>
            I work daily with Python, PostgreSQL, Docker/Linux, and AWS. I have
            special experience in web scraping (e.g. 
            <a href="https://lobbyist.oico.on.ca/Pages/Public/PublicSearch/">this piece of 
            work</a>) and in data engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            I assist or lead the fact-finding process for all our databases. The 
            <a href="https://theijf.org/procurement-introduction">handbook</a> I wrote for
            our Procurement data describes our process and our perennial challenges.
